MPU6050 Module Hardware Overview
_________________________________

It can measure angular momentum or rotation along all three axes, static acceleration caused by gravity, and dynamic acceleration caused by motion, shock, or vibration.

The module includes an on-board LD3985 3.3V regulator, so you can safely use it with a 5V logic microcontroller like Arduino.

The MPU6050 consumes less than 3.6mA during measurements and only 5μA when idle.
