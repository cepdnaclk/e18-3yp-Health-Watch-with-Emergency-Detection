MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter Sensor
------------------------------

The blood Oxygen Concentration termed SpO2 is measured in Percentage and Heart Beat/Pulse Rate is measured in BPM.
Oxygen enters the lungs and then is passed on into blood. The blood carries oxygen to the various organs in our body. The main way oxygen is carried in our blood is by means of hemoglobin

volatge: 1.8V to 3.3V
Ultra-Low Shutdown Current (0.7ÂµA)

The device has two LEDs, one emitting red light, another emitting infrared light. For pulse rate, only infrared light is needed. Both red light and infrared light are used to measure oxygen levels in the blood

When the heart pumps blood, there is an increase in oxygenated blood as a result of having more blood. As the heart relaxes, the volume of oxygenated blood also decreases. By knowing the time between the increase and decrease of oxygenated blood, the pulse rate is determined.

oxygenated blood absorbs more infrared light and passes more red light while deoxygenated blood absorbs red light and passes more infrared light. This is the main function of the MAX30100: it reads the absorption levels for both light sources and stores them in a buffer that can be read via I2C communication protocol.

ports:
Vin, GND, SCL(serial clock), SDA(serial data)
we need to download MAX30100 library
accuracy rate of the Max30100 measurement is 97.11% and 98.84%, for heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2), respectively
Initially the the BPM & SpO2 value appears as incorrect value but soon you can observe the correct stable reading.(after about 5 to 10 readings)
there is an issue: refere the below link
