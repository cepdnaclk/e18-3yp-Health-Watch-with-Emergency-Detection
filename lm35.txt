LM35 Temperature Sensor
-----------------------

It has an accuracy of ±¼°C at room temperature and ±¾°C over a full −55°C to 150°C temperature range.
The LM35 series are precision integrated-circuit temperature devices with an output voltage linearly- proportional to the Centigrade temperature.
The LM35 does not need any exterior calibration
The LM35 has an output voltage that is proportional to the Celsius temperature. The scale factor is 0.01V/°C.
Vin: 4V to 30V
current draw: 60uA
provides analog output(voltage)
